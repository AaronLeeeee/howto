  <description>specpattern is an example desktop application and
systemd-enabled service. Or just a daemon. It doesn't currently
require or even use the port listed below, but this serves as an
example that if your program did use that port, you can have a nice
tidy firewalld definition file in order to make managing it much
easier. The port was picked at random.</description>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="8436"/>
</service>
